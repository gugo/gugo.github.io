		    <p>Moodwall is an interactive experience developed by our team during a private event called "Showcase Leather Mood", which took place the 28th of june 2016 for the launch of five new hides collections for FW 17/18 by four reknown italian tanneries from Santa Croce sull'Arno and Naples.</p>

		<p>A moodboard is an arrangement of images, materials, pieces of text, intended to evoke or project a particular style or concept.</p>
		<p>The goal of our interactive moodboard is to connect the tactile feeling of the leather textures to five particular moods by means of an interactive multisensorial experience capable of driving our user into a world made of colors, images, shapes and sounds respectively controlled through five leather lined concrete solids.</p>

		<p>Each solid is weighing approximately 4 lb and has been carefully crafted with concrete by our team, using 3D printed PLA molds. At the core of each one of them a lodge is holding our customized electronic bluetooth controller. These pieces, developed using opensource technologies like RFduinos and Adafruit BNO055, are sensing the rotational and positional data of the sculptures sending them to our custom built Cinder application in order to control and navigate through multiple 3D environments textured by a database of mood matched inspirational images and videos.</p>
