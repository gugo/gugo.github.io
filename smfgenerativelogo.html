		  	<p>Scuola di Musica di Fiesole is an international remarkable reality in the field of classical music education.</p>
		  	<p>Established in 1974 by Piero Farulli, legendary viola of the "Quartetto Italiano", the school has 1.300 students from all over the world, 7 orchestras, 6 choirs, 140 teachers. Is also very active in classical music events organization with more than 280 events every year.</p>
		    <p>This success has been made possible also by the collaboration with important artist like Riccardo Muti, Salvatore Accardo, Luciano Berio, Claudio Abbado and many more.Due to a refurbishment need of the institution, the Scuola Musica Fiesole foundation asked the ISIA of Florence for a restyling of their previous identity, following a few guidelines: a contemporary look and feel, a strong connection between the new logo and music, great flexibility to describe their complex structural reality.</p>
		    <p>We developed the idea of a generative logo that could be continuously redesigned by music. Starting from the basic elements of the music the 12 notes of the chromatic scale, we designed a dodecagonal structure (a common shape in music theory, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths) on which was possible to design logos with armonic progressions. The root notes of those chords are the letters from A to G (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) taken from the names of which to design the logo.</p>
		    <p>Here's the <a href="smf/logo.html" target="_blank">beta</a> of the application</p>
